A bunch of little things I made in my freetime


### PyPong
A simple pong game made in Python and Pygame.

### Maze Runner
A maze app that uses Deep Field Search (DFS) to make a perfect maze and then uses the same algorithm in reverse to solve. 
**Usage**: Run it, enter your resolution, and let it run! Press "Escape" at anytime to quit.
**ToDo**: A more elegant "reset" method
