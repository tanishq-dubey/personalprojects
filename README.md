A bunch of little things I made in my freetime


### PyPong
A simple pong game made in Python and Pygame.
**Changes Made**: Made the AI a bit (a lot) worse, you can actually win now.

### Maze Runner
A maze app that uses Deep Field Search (DFS) to make a perfect maze and then uses the same algorithm in reverse to solve. Requires PyGame.
**Usage**: Run it, enter your resolution, and let it run! Press "Escape" at anytime to quit.
**Changes Made**: Exits more elegantly, colors are more visible.

### Find the Cow
A joke of a game inspired by a conversation at dinner with friends. I challenged myself to keep it under 100 lines of code. Requires PyGame.
**Usage**: Click to guess where the cow is. The volume of the "moo" indicates how far away the cow is. Once the cow is found, press spacebar to go to the next level.
**ToDo**: Add a menu, although, I want to keep this under 100 lines of code.

### Binary Clock
Something I thought I would finish, but never had the initative. It was supposed to be a simple 5 row binary clock. Maybe someday it will get a life.
